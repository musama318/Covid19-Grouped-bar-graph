The graph above shows the progress of the disease once the number of infected people crossed the 100-mark. Since the epidemic has traveled to the different states at different times, the trajectories of the number of infected differ, but it seems to follow the same pattern once you adjust the graph to show the days adjusted to when Maharashtra reached 100 infections.
